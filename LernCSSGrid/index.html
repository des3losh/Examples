            <h3>An abstract summarizes, usually in one paragraph of 300 words or less,
                the major aspects of the entire paper in a prescribed sequence that includes:
            </h3>
            <p>
                1.	the overall purpose of the study and the research problem(s) you investigated; <br>
                2.	the basic design of the study; <br>
                3.	major findings or trends found as a result of your analysis; and, <br>
                4.	a brief summary of your interpretations and conclusions.   <br>
            </p>   

            <h3>The abstract allows you to elaborate upon each major aspect of the paper and
                helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper.
            </h3>
            <p>
                How do you know when you have enough information in your abstract? 
                A simple rule-of-thumb is to imagine that you are another researcher doing a similar study.
                Then ask yourself: if your abstract was the only part of the paper you could access,
                would you be happy with the amount of information presented there? Does it tell 
                the whole story about your study? If the answer is "no" then the abstract likely 
                needs to be revised.
